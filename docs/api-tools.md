# API Tools
{: .no_toc}

BrainSTEM provides comprehensive API tools to facilitate programmatic access to your neuroscience data. These tools are designed to integrate seamlessly with common research workflows and programming environments.

## Available Tools

### MATLAB API Tool
A native MATLAB interface for BrainSTEM that enables direct integration with MATLAB-based analysis pipelines. Perfect for researchers already using MATLAB for data processing and visualization.

### Python API Tool  
A Python library providing full access to the BrainSTEM API with intuitive methods for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. Ideal for Python-based data science workflows and integration with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

### Web API Tool
A browser-based interface for exploring and testing API endpoints without writing code. This tool allows you to:
- Browse available endpoints interactively
- Test queries and filters
- View response formats
- Generate code snippets for MATLAB and Python

## Getting Started

Choose the tool that best fits your workflow:
- **For MATLAB users**: Start with the [MATLAB API tool](/api-tools/matlab-api-tool/)
- **For Python users**: Begin with the [Python API tool](/api-tools/python-api-tool/)  
- **For exploration**: Try the [Web API tool](/api-tools/web-api-tool/) in your browser

All tools use the same underlying [API endpoints](/api/) and support consistent authentication and query patterns.
