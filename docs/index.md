# Documentation for BrainSTEM 
{: .no_toc}
{: .fs-9 }
BrainSTEM is a collaborative electronic lab notebook for FAIR experimental neuroscience. It has a customizable web interface built on a flexible data model and is designed to capture a range of electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral data collection. Granular permissions, including one-click public sharing, promotes collaborations and open science.

## Introduction
{: .no_toc}
This website is dedicated to the documentation and support for BrainSTEM, including the data model, the web interface, the API, the public data, and tutorials. Please see the section below on feature requests and bug reporting.

BrainSTEM (Brain STructured Experimental Metadata) is designed as an electronic notebook to capture a range of electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral data collection. It is built on a modular, standardized yet flexible data model that can be extended to capture future types of data as well. Granular permissions enables collaborations within and across labs, and one-click public sharing of datasets. It has a customizable web interface that allows for the organization of experiments and raw data. BrainSTEM also has a REST API, for programmable access, with toolsets being built for Matlab and Python. 

BrainSTEM is in a pilot stage, so please reach out if you are interested in helping advancing and shaping it.

## Getting started

1. __Create a user account__: Visit the register page [https://brainstem.org/register/](https://brainstem.org/register/) and fill in your personal info, including name, email and password.
2. __Create or join a group__: Once you are in your dashboard, click the __Groups__ link in the left side menu. Create your own group by clicking __+ Add group__ in the top right above the list of groups. To join an existing group, find the group you would like to join from the list and click __request membership__. A group administer must now accept your request. 
3. __Create or join a project__: Go to the projects page via the Projects link in the left side menu. Create a project by clicking __+ Add project__ at the top right above the list of projects. If you join an existing group you inherit permissions to the group's projects, and they should be visible on the projects page. 

That's it! Now you can use the web interface and API tools for your experimental data. We strongly recommend exploring some of the tutorials to help you get acquainted with BrainSTEM.
