## Introduction
{: .no_toc}
BrainSTEM (Brain STructured Experimental Metadata) is designed to capture a range of electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral data collection, and is built on a flexible data model so it can be extended to capture future types of data as well. Granular permissions enables private collaboration within and across labs, and one click public sharing of datasets. It has a customizable web interface that allows for the organization of experiments and raw data. The database of metadata can also be accessed through a REST API with availabe toolsets for Matlab and Python.

## Getting started
1. Create a user account
2. Create or join a group
3. Create or join a project

That's it! Now you can use the web interface and API tools to describe your experimental data. We strongly recommend exploring some of the tutorials to help you get acquainted with BrainSTEM.
