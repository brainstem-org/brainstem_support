# BrainSTEM
{: .no_toc}
{: .fs-9 }

BrainSTEM is a collaborative electronic lab notebook for FAIR experimental neuroscience. It has a customizable web interface built on a flexible data model and functions as an electronic lab notebook that allows for the organization of experiments and raw data. Granular access control enables collaboration within or across labs. The database of metadata can be accessed through either a web interface or REST API. A prototype of this tool has been deployed in the Buzs√°ki Lab, and a beta version for broad distribution is currently under development.

## Introduction
{: .no_toc}
BrainSTEM (Brain STructured Experimental Metadata) is a centralized, collaborative electronic lab notebook for experimental neuroscience that facilitates compliance with NIH and other data sharing requirements. BrainSTEM was designed with ease of adoption and use as a primary consideration.

It is a web-based tool, so no technical know how is needed to use it, and the interface can be customized for the data, materials, and personnel of a particular lab or group to streamline the process of collecting metadata. It is designed to capture a range of electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral data collection, and is built on a flexible data model so it can be extended to capture other types of data as well. Granular permissions allow access control to enable private collaboration within and across labs, and one click public sharing of datasets.

## Getting started
1. Create a user account
2. Create or join a group
3. Create or join a project

That's it! Now you can use the web interface and API tools to describe your experimental data. We recommend exploring some of the tutorials to help you get acquainted with BrainSTEM.
