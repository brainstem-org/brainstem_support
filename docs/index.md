## Introduction
{: .no_toc}

BrainSTEM (Brain Structured Experimental Metadata) is a collaborative electronic lab notebook designed specifically for experimental neuroscience. It captures and organizes a comprehensive range of electrophysiological, imaging, and behavioral data through a modular, standardized data model that can be extended to accommodate future data types.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Management**: Organize sessions, subjects, procedures, and experimental metadata in one platform
- **Collaborative Research**: Granular permissions enable seamless collaboration within and across laboratories
- **Public Data Sharing**: One-click public sharing of sessions for open science initiatives
- **Programmable Access**: Full API with dedicated toolsets for MATLAB and Python
- **Customizable Interface**: Web-based interface tailored for neuroscience research workflows
- **Standardized Metadata**: Consistent data annotation using controlled vocabularies and taxonomies

BrainSTEM is ready for public use, and encourage researchers to create an account and begin exploring the platform. Your feedback helps us advance and shape the future of collaborative neuroscience data management.
