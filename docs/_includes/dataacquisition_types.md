These are the available *Type* options for data acquisition:

### Audio and Behavior Tracking
- `Audio`: Recordings of sounds, vocalizations, or auditory stimuli. These datasets aid in examining how the brain processes sound, supports communication, and integrates auditory information into behavior.
- `Behavioral Tracking`: Monitoring and quantifying subjects’ movements, actions, and responses under specific conditions. This information is vital for linking neural activity to behavior, learning, memory, and decision-making processes.

### Electrophysiology
- `Electroencephalography (EEG)`: Non-invasive recordings of the brain’s electrical activity from electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG helps researchers study large-scale neural dynamics, sleep states, sensory processing, and cognitive functions.
- `Electroneurogram (ENG)`: Direct measurements of electrical activity from nerves or neurons in the central or peripheral nervous system. ENG data elucidate how neural signals propagate and inform on nerve health and function.
- `Extracellular Electrophysiology`: Recordings of neuronal signals from outside the cells. This method allows for simultaneous long-term monitoring of multiple neurons, providing insight into network dynamics and population coding.
- `Intracellular Electrophysiology`: High-precision recordings of a single cell’s electrical activity using a microelectrode inserted into the neuron. Intracellular data reveal subthreshold events, synaptic inputs, and intrinsic cellular properties.

### Optical Imaging
- `Fiber Photometry`: A calcium imaging technique capturing population-level neural activity changes via light signals. It is especially useful for studying the dynamics of specific cell types within a brain circuit.
- `Miniscope Microscopy`: Small, head-mounted microscopes that let researchers visualize large populations of neurons in freely moving animals, bridging the gap between naturalistic behavior and underlying neural activity.
- `Confocal Microscopy`: An optical imaging technique that uses a pinhole to achieve high-resolution, high-contrast images and 3D reconstructions. Commonly applied to study cellular structures and brain tissue morphology.
- `Light Field Microscopy`: A scanning-free, 3D imaging method capturing entire light fields, enabling rapid volumetric imaging at micron-scale resolution. Ideal for reconstructing complex neural circuits in three dimensions.
- `Single-Photon Microscopy`: A fluorescence imaging method utilizing single-photon excitation for detailed observation of cellular and subcellular structures in living tissue.
- `Two-Photon Microscopy`: A fluorescence imaging technique using near-infrared light for deeper imaging in scattering tissue. It is well-suited for probing functional neuronal activity in intact brain tissue.
- `Three-Photon Microscopy`: A nonlinear optical method employing three-photon excitation to achieve deeper penetration and higher spatial resolution, allowing imaging of neuronal activity in challenging tissue environments.

### Magnetic and Functional Imaging
- `Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)`: Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed anatomical images of the brain and other organs, without ionizing radiation. MRI is a cornerstone of structural brain imaging.
- `Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)`: Measures brain activity indirectly through changes in blood flow. fMRI helps map functional networks, cognitive states, and sensory-motor processing.
- `Magnetoencephalography (MEG)`: Detects the magnetic fields produced by neuronal activity. With excellent temporal resolution, MEG provides insights into real-time brain dynamics and functional connectivity.

### Tomography and Ultrasound
- `Computed Tomography (CT)`: An X-ray-based imaging modality that produces cross-sectional images of internal brain structures, aiding in the identification of pathologies and structural abnormalities.
- `Positron Emission Tomography (PET)`: Uses radioactive tracers to visualize metabolic processes and physiological activities. PET is invaluable for studying neurotransmitter systems, blood flow, and metabolic states in the brain.
- `Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)`: A nuclear imaging technique capturing 3D information on functional processes. SPECT data are often used alongside other imaging modalities for comprehensive analysis.
- `Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUS)`: Measures changes in blood flow or metabolism related to neural activity. As a non-invasive method with high spatial and temporal resolution, fUS is emerging as a versatile neuroimaging tool.

### General and Time-Series Data
- `General Time-Series`: Any continuous, time-dependent data—such as neural firing rates, physiological signals, or behavioral readouts—used to analyze temporal patterns, rhythms, and dynamics in neural and physiological systems.
