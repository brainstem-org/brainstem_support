These are the available *Type* options for Procedure:

### Surgical Procedures:
- `Craniectomy`: The surgical removal of a portion of the skull that is not replaced afterward. This approach provides prolonged, direct access to the brain or helps relieve increased intracranial pressure following injury.
- `Craniotomy`: A procedure in which part of the skull is temporarily removed to expose the brain. After surgery or research activities are completed, the bone flap is typically replaced, restoring the skull’s integrity.
- `Cranial window`: A surgical technique where a small section of skull is replaced with a transparent window. This allows for direct, long-term optical access to the brain’s surface for imaging and other optical investigations.

### Implant Procedures:
- `Optic fiber implant`: The surgical placement of a tiny optic fiber into brain tissue, commonly used in optogenetics. By delivering or detecting light, researchers can modulate or record neuronal activity in precise brain regions.
- `Silicon probe implant`: The insertion of a silicon-based probe equipped with multiple recording sites. These probes enable high-density recordings from many neurons simultaneously, facilitating detailed studies of neural circuits.
- `Single wire electrode`: The implantation of a thin wire electrode into the brain for recording electrical activity or stimulating neurons. This targeted approach aids in understanding single-neuron contributions to brain function.
- `Tetrode wire electrode`: The introduction of a four-wire electrode (tetrode) bundle into the brain. Tetrodes allow researchers to monitor and differentiate signals from multiple adjacent neurons, greatly enhancing the resolution of neural recordings.

### Injection and Infusion Procedures:
- `Injection`: The delivery of solutions, often containing genetic or pharmacological agents, directly into targeted brain areas. This method is commonly performed using a small glass capillary and can be used to alter gene expression or modulate neural activity.
- `Virus injection`: Similar to the above, but specifically involves injecting viral vectors to introduce or manipulate genetic material in targeted neuronal populations. This approach is key for studying gene function and developing gene therapies.

### Brain and Tissue Procedures:
- `Brain lesion`: A deliberate injury or destruction of a specific brain region to investigate its role in behavior, cognition, and physiological processes. Lesion studies help map functions to particular brain areas.
- `Brain perfusion fixation`: A tissue-preservation method in which a fixative solution is perfused through the circulatory system, stabilizing the brain’s structure for microscopic examination. This technique ensures that cellular and tissue-level details are well-preserved.
- `Brain slice`: The preparation of thin, ex vivo sections of brain tissue for detailed examination. Brain slices can be used for electrophysiological recordings, imaging, and testing pharmacological agents, providing insights into local circuit properties.
