These are the available *Type* options for Subject logs:

- `Food consumption log`: Records the amount and type of food consumed by the subject. This information is crucial for studies examining the effects of diet on health, behavior, or disease progression.
- `Food deprivation log`: Documents periods when food is withheld from the subject. Food deprivation can be used as a motivational tool in behavioral experiments or to study the physiological and psychological effects of fasting.
- `Housing log`: Keeps track of the subject's living conditions, including the cage type, housing, location, light cycle, and any environmental enrichment. This log helps ensure that housing conditions remain consistent and meet ethical standards.
- `Water consumption log`: Details the amount of water consumed by the subject. Monitoring water intake is essential for studies related to hydration, kidney function, or the effects of various substances on thirst and water balance.
- `Water deprivation log`: Notes periods during which water is withheld from the subject. Similar to food deprivation, water deprivation can be used to study the effects of hydration status on various physiological and behavioral outcomes.
- `Weighing log`: Records the subject's body weight over time. Regular weighing is critical for monitoring health, growth, and the effects of experimental treatments on body mass.
- `Wellness log`: Documents observations related to the subject's general health and well-being, including behavior, physical appearance, signs of distress, or illness. This log is essential for ensuring the ethical treatment of research subjects and for interpreting the effects of experimental manipulations on overall health.
