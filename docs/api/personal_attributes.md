# Personal Attributes API Endpoints

The Personal Attributes app manages user-specific configurations, experimental setups, and personalized data organization. This module allows researchers to define and maintain their individual experimental environments, equipment configurations, and behavioral paradigms.

## Available Endpoints

The Personal Attributes app includes the following endpoints:

- **[Setups](/api/personal_attributes/setup/)** - Personal experimental setup configurations
- **[Behavioral Paradigms](/api/personal_attributes/behavioralparadigm/)** - Custom behavioral task definitions and equipment tracking
- **[Data Storage](/api/personal_attributes/datastorage/)** - Personal data storage configurations and locations
- **[Inventory](/api/personal_attributes/inventory/)** - Personal laboratory inventory and consumables

These endpoints enable researchers to customize their experimental environments while maintaining consistency across studies.

## Common Use Cases

- Configure personal experimental setups and equipment arrangements
- Define custom behavioral paradigms for specific research needs
- Manage personal data storage locations and backup configurations
- Track personal laboratory inventory and equipment usage
- Maintain consistent experimental configurations across sessions
- Share setup configurations with collaborators
- Document equipment calibrations and maintenance schedules
