## Overview

The BrainSTEM import tool helps you add data to BrainSTEM by uploading CSV files. Instead of creating CSV files from scratch, you download pre-built templates for each data type, edit them with your data, and upload them.

**ðŸŽ¯ How it works**: Download template â†’ Edit with your data â†’ Upload â†’ Review results

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. Go to the import tool page
2. Select your data type (e.g., "subjects", "procedures")
3. Click "Download CSV Template"
4. Open the downloaded file and replace the example data with your data
5. Upload the modified CSV file
6. Check the results for any errors

### Why Use Templates?

âœ… **No mistakes** - Templates have correct column names and formatting

âœ… **Faster** - All required fields are already included

âœ… **Better examples** - Shows you exactly how to format your data

### Finding Your UUIDs

Some templates need IDs from your existing BrainSTEM data. These are marked as `YOUR_*_ID` in the templates:

| Template ID | Where to find it |
| --- | --- |
| `YOUR_PROCEDURE_ID` | Admin â†’ Procedures â†’ Click edit â†’ Copy ID from URL |
| `YOUR_EQUIPMENT_ID` | Admin â†’ Equipment â†’ Click edit â†’ Copy ID from URL |
| `YOUR_CONSUMABLESTOCK_ID` | Admin â†’ Consumable Stock â†’ Click edit â†’ Copy ID from URL |
| `YOUR_SETUP_ID` | Admin â†’ Setup â†’ Click edit â†’ Copy ID from URL |
| `YOUR_BEHAVIORAL_PARADIGM_ID` | Admin â†’ Behavioral Paradigm â†’ Click edit â†’ Copy ID from URL |

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: The ID is the long string of letters and numbers in the URL when you're editing a record.

## Input conventions
- Column headers must follow the pattern `<entity>__<field>` and match exactly; unrecognised columns are ignored.
- CSVs are read with `pandas.read_csv`, so values may be wrapped in double quotes or left bareâ€”both are accepted.
- Trimming happens automatically, but lookups remain case-sensitive. Keep names â‰¤200 characters to stay within model limits.
- Boolean fields accept `true/false`, `yes/no`, `1/0`, `on/off`, or `enabled/disabled` in any casing (for example `TRUE`, `0`). Blank values resolve to `false`.
- Datetimes accept ISO-8601 (`2024-05-01T14:30`), spaced formats (`2024-05-01 14:30[:45]`), and regional variants (`05/01/2024`, `01/05/2024 14:30`). Dates accept the same patterns without a time component.
- List-style columns must use comma-separated values with no brackets (for example `behavior, imaging, ephys`). The importer splits on commas and trims whitespace.
- JSON columns must contain valid JSON objects; malformed JSON raises a warning and the field is skipped. Example: `{"laserPower": 5, "units": "mW"}`.
- Rich-text fields (project, subject, session, cohort, collection descriptions) are backed by CKEditor and therefore accept HTML. Because inline scripts and event handlers will render, keep inputs to simple formatting (paragraphs, bold, italics, links) to avoid introducing interactive content.

## Error handling
- Missing required fields stop the current row and record an error; later rows are still evaluated.
- Lookup failures on required relationships raise errors; missing optional lookups generate warnings and skip only the unresolved relationship.
- Invalid JSON, date, or datetime values raise warnings and the affected field is removed before the API call.
- Duplicate Subject Log entries and other unique-constraint hits are reported as warnings and counted as existing records.

## Tips for Success

### Before You Import

1. **Download the right template** for your data type
2. **Check existing data** to avoid duplicates (especially for projects, subjects, sessions)
3. **Find your UUIDs** if the template needs them (see guide above)
4. **Back up your data** before bulk imports

### Common Issues

- **Missing required fields** - The template will show you which fields are required
- **Wrong date format** - Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **Invalid JSON** - Copy the exact format from template examples
- **UUID not found** - Double-check that the ID exists in your system

### After Import

- Review the results for any errors or warnings
- Fix any issues in your CSV and re-upload
- Check that your data appears correctly in BrainSTEM

**ðŸ’¡ Remember**: Templates are your best friend - they prevent most common import errors!
