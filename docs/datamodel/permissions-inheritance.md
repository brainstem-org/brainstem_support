### Projects
Projects have four permission levels that can be defined for individual groups and users:
- Members: have read access to project-related subjects, datasets, and module data.
- Change permissions: allows for creation, editing and deletion of project related models.
- Managers: can add and remove project members and project groups.
- Owners: can manage project details and add and remove managers.

### Groups
Groups have three permission levels:  
- Members inherit project-permissions assigned to group: including change, manager and owner project-permissions.
- Managers can add and remove group members.
- Owners can manage Group details and add and remove managers.
