## Introduction

Equipment refer to the setup and utilization of various devices and sensors designed to monitor, record, or manipulate environmental variables or subject responses. These equipment are critical for creating controlled experimental conditions, collecting data, and delivering stimuli. Each equipment type has specific applications and functions within setups. While equipment types share relationships, fields are tailored to the various equipment types. The types of equipment currently supported by BrainSTEM are listed below.
