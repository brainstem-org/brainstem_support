# Schemas

The Schemas in BrainSTEM define the structure and organization of data for various components of the platform. They ensure consistency and standardization across different types of information. The main schema categories include:

- __Coordinates systems__: Defines the structure for representing spatial locations within the brain across different coordinate systems and species.

- __Experiment data types__: Specifies the data fields and organization for various types of experimental data, such as electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral measurements.

- __Manipulation types__: Outlines the data fields for various types of experimental manipulations and interventions.

- __Procedure types__: Specifies the structure for describing different surgical and experimental procedures.

- __Subject log types__: Defines the data organization for tracking subject-related information over time.

- __Action log types__: Provides a structured system for recording specific parameters or outcomes related to actions performed during experiments.

- __Consumables types__: Outlines the data structure for different types of consumable resources used in experiments.
