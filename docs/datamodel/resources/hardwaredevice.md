## Introduction

Hardware devices refer to durable, often more complex equipment or tools that are not consumed or depleted with use, unlike consumables. These devices are designed for repeated use over a long period and play crucial roles in conducting experiments, data acquisition, performing stimulation and manipulation protocols, and carrying out procedures. In BrainSTEM, hardware devices are a shared model across users.

## Fields

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| ``Name of hardware device`` | The name of the hardware device (**required**; string; maximum length: 100 characters; must be unique). Example: "RHD2000 USB Interface Board" |
| ``Supplier`` | The supplier of the hardware device (**required**). Must reference an existing [supplier]({{"datamodel/resources/supplier/"|absolute_url}}). Example: "Intan Technologies" |
| ``Type`` | The type of hardware device (**optional**). Selected from predefined categories. Example: "Data acquisition system" |
| ``RRID`` | Research Resource Identifier (optional). Must start with "RRID:". Example: "RRID:SCR_123456" |
| ``External identifiers`` | External identifiers from databases like manufacturer IDs, model numbers, DOI, etc. (optional). Include URLs when available. |
| ``Type specific fields`` | Type-specific fields in JSON format. Fields vary by hardware device type. Example: For amplifier - specifications, input/output details. |
| ``Description`` | Description of the hardware device (optional; maximum length: 2000 characters). Can include uploaded images. Example: "USB interface board for RHD2000 series digital electrophysiology recording systems..." |
| ``Adding/editing comments`` | Comments for the submission/approval process (optional). |

## Submission process

Anyone can submit hardware devices or submit changes to existing ones, but all submissions must be approved before they are available for usage. Please see existing entries for examples of what to submit.

## Permissions

Once an entry has been approved, it becomes available to everyone.

## API access

The API allows for programmable access to hardware devices, enabling you to read, edit, and delete entries through the API. Learn more about the hardware devices' fields and data structure on the [Hardware devices API page]({{"api/resources/hardwaredevice/"|absolute_url}}).
