# Personal attributes

Personal attributes are model elements that are typically shared within individual laboratories or research groups. These attributes allow for customization and flexibility in describing experimental setups and protocols that may be specific to a particular lab or research focus. The main categories of personal attributes are:

- [**Behavioral paradigms**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/behavioralparadigm): Detailed descriptions of specific behavioral tasks and protocols used in a lab.

- [**Data storages**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/datastorage): Information about local data storage solutions and practices used within a lab. This can include details about file systems, naming conventions, and data organization strategies specific to the research group.


- [**Inventories**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/inventory): Manages comprehensive lists of laboratory consumables. Each inventory can be associated with specific groups and users, enabling efficient resource tracking and sharing across the laboratory.

- [**Setups**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/setup): Descriptions of the physical arrangements and equipment configurations used for experiments. Setups may be unique to a particular lab or research question.
