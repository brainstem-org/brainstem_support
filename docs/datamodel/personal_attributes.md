# Personal attributes

Personal attributes in BrainSTEM are model elements that are typically shared within individual laboratories or research groups. These attributes allow for customization and flexibility in describing experimental setups and protocols that may be specific to a particular lab or research focus. The main categories of personal attributes are:

- [**Behavioral paradigm**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/behavioral_paradigm): Detailed descriptions of specific behavioral tasks or experimental protocols used in a lab.

- [**Data storage**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/data_storage): Information about local data storage solutions and practices used within a lab. This can include details about file systems, naming conventions, and data organization strategies specific to the research group.

- [**Experimental setups**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/experiment_setups): Descriptions of the physical arrangements and equipment configurations used for experiments. These setups may be unique to a particular lab or research question.

- [**Inventories**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/personal_attributes/inventories): Manages comprehensive lists of all laboratory resources, including equipment, consumables, and tools. Each inventory can be associated with specific projects or research groups, enabling efficient resource tracking and sharing across the laboratory.
