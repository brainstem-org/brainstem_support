# Resources

Resources in BrainSTEM represent the various materials, equipment, and entities involved in neuroscience research. These include consumables, hardware devices, and suppliers. The Resources model is designed to be expandable through user submissions, allowing for a comprehensive and up-to-date catalog of research materials.

- [**Consumables**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/resources/consumables): Items used in experiments that are typically depleted or have a limited lifespan. Each type of consumable is described by specific fields relevant to its characteristics and use.

- [**Hardware devices**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/resources/hardware_devices): Durable equipment used in experiments, including computers, acquisition systems, and stimulators. These devices are typically used repeatedly across multiple experiments.

- [**Suppliers**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/resources/suppliers): Entities that provide consumables or hardware devices. These can be companies, laboratories, or individuals. Supplier information helps in tracking the source and consistency of research materials.
