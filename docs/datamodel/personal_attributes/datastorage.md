You manage permissions through the management tab, where you can assign individual users and groups access levels to a data storage. Data storage have four permission levels: membership (read access), contributors, managers, and owners.

Visit the [permissions page]({{"datamodel/permissions/"|absolute_url}}) to learn more.
