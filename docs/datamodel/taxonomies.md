# Taxonomies

Taxonomies in BrainSTEM provide standardized vocabularies and classification systems for various aspects of neuroscience research. These taxonomies ensure consistency in naming and categorization across different experiments and research groups. The main categories of taxonomies are:

- __Brain regions atlas__: A comprehensive listing of brain regions based on established atlases. 

- __Species and strains__: A catalog of animal species and their specific strains used in neuroscience research. 

- __Environment types__: A classification system for different experimental environments and setups. 

Please see the dedicated pages below for more detailed information on each of the taxonomy types:
