# Taxonomies

Taxonomies provide standardized vocabularies and classification systems for various aspects of neuroscience research. These taxonomies ensure consistency in naming and categorization across different experiments and research groups. The main categories of taxonomies are:

- [**Behavioral categories**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/behavioralcategory): Behavioral categories provide a two-level hierarchical classification for organizing behavioral paradigms into meaningful groups by cognitive domain or experimental focus.

- [**Behavioral paradigms**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/behavioralparadigm): Behavioral paradigms represent standardized behavioral tasks and protocols shared across the neuroscience community. A paradigm describes the conceptual approach to assessing a particular behavior — independent of any specific lab's implementation or physical apparatus.

- [**Brain regions**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/brainregion): A comprehensive listing of brain regions based on established atlases that provides standardized neuroanatomical references for precise targeting and documentation.

- [**Setup types**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/setuptype): A classification system for different experimental setups, ensuring consistent categorization of behavioral testing areas and research spaces.

- [**Species**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/species): A catalog of animal species used in neuroscience research, including their biological characteristics and experimental applications.

- [**Strains**]({{site.baseurl}}/datamodel/taxonomies/strain): A listing of genetic variants and breeding lines within species, documenting specific genetic backgrounds and phenotypic characteristics relevant to neuroscience research.
