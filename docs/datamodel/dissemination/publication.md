## Submission process

Any user can submit new publication entries or propose changes to existing ones. However, all submissions must undergo an approval process before becoming available for use. Please refer to existing entries for examples of appropriate submissions.

## Permissions

Once a publication entry has been approved, it becomes accessible to all users.

## API access

The API provides programmable access to publication data, allowing you to read, edit, and delete entries. For more information about the fields and data structure of publication entries, please consult the [Publications API page]({{"api/dissemination/publication/"|absolute_url}}).
