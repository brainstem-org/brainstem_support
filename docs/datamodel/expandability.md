# Expandability
The data model is built around a standardized structure that maintains expandability allowing for incorporation of new methods, techniques, data types, resources and expanded taxonomies.

New entries in Taxonomies and Resources can be submitted by users. Any submission goes through an approval by a dedicated admin team.

### Expansion of the modules structures
{: .no_toc }

The available modules the user can select between in procedures, data acquisition, consumable stocks, equipment, and manipulations, can be expanded by our admin team. If you wish for this, please submit a request through the issue/discussion forum.

### Personal attributes
{: .no_toc }

The personal attributes can be fully managed by the users.
