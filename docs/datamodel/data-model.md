# Relational data model
The relational model can be separated into three levels:
1. Organization and permissions level
2. Module data
3. Backend with taxonomies and resources.

## Employment of standardization while maintaining expandability
The data model consists of 6 categories
Stem data
- Projects
- Subjects
- Datasets 
- Collections

Module data
- Actions
- Behaviors
- Experiment data
- Manipulations

Permissions and ownership
- Users
- Groups
- Laboratories

Resources (+)
- Suppliers
- Consumables
- Hardware devices

Taxonomies (+)
- Brain regions atlas
- Species and strains
- Environment types

Personal attributes
- Behavioral paradigms
- Data repositories
- Physical environments

Module data are standardized yet flexible containers for describing the experimental conditions. 

Resources & taxonomies are expandable through user submissions. We are using existing standards and controlled vocabulary when possible and hope to establish standards where none exists.

Personal attributes are model elements that typically are shared within labs: local data storage, various in-house built environments for experiments, and behavioral paradigms, which we chose not to standardized on a wider scale.

## Example use of  the flexible modular design
Extracellular recording during a behavioral session from a rat.
