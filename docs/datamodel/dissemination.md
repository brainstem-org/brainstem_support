# Dissemination

The Dissemination model in BrainSTEM focuses on capturing information related to the publication and sharing of research findings. It consists of two main components:

- __Journals__: This component records information about scientific journals where research findings are published. It includes details such as the journal name, description, and website.

- __Publications__: This component documents specific research publications. It includes fields for the publication title, authors, journal, abstract, DOI, volume, publication date, and URLs for the publication and any publicly accessible PDF versions. Like journals, publication entries are shared across all BrainSTEM users.

Please see the dedicated pages below for the models within the dissemination app:
