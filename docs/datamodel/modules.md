# Modules

- __Actions__: Actions performed on subjects, including implants (e.g. probes, wires, and fibers), injections (e.g. virus injections). Actions allow for recording from a subject or manipulate its state.  
- __Behaviors__: Animal behaviors are described by the experimental setup (also included VR) and what behavioral paradigm the animal is doing/trained to do. 
- __Experiment data__: Captures all data collection performed on or centered around a subject. This includes Audio recordings, behavioral tracking with cameras, electrophysiological recordings, and imaging. 
- __Installations__: Installations performed in a experimental setup, including camera setups, screens, thermal installations, speakers, sensors, and microphones. Installations allow for recording from an environment or manipulate its state.
- __Manipulations__: Manipulations are any time-dependent manipulation performed on an animal subject, that changes its state. This includes any electrical, light or sensory stimulation, liquid perturbation, optogentical stimulation, perfusions,  inhalations, superfusions, injections, and ultrasound. Manipulations are described through an action and parameters that are specific to the type of manipulation. E.g. an electrical stimulation is described by its amplitude, duration, duty cycle, and repetitions, while a liquid perturbation by the liquid agent, concentration, the volume, flow rate and repetitions.
- __Action logs__: Action logs are changes applied to an action entry. 
- __Subject logs__: Subject logs are simpler log values applied to a subject, including food consumption, weighing, and water consumption. 

Module data tables are standardized yet flexible containers for describing the experimental conditions.
