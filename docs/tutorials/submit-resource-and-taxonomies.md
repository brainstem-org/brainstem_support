# Submitting resources and taxonomies
{: .no_toc}

Resources and taxonomies are controlled list, but can be expanded by user submissions. In any of the resources and taxonomies, entry are simply added through a form, like any other.   Any submission must be approved by the admin team. You can monitor the process on the approval pages: [https://www.brainstem.org/private/approvals/](https://www.brainstem.org/private/approvals/)

Once approved, the submitted entry will be selectable from the dropdowns.
