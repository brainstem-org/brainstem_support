{: .no_toc}
Groups has three levels of membership: members, managers, and owners. The owners can associate the group with a laboratory, rename the group and administer managers of the group. The managers can add and remove regular members of the group. Regular members can only leave the group. Members inherit project-permissions assigned to group: including change, manager and owner project-permissions.

To manage a group, go the the groups page [https://brainstem.org/private/auth/group/](https://brainstem.org/private/auth/group/) and click the group from the list you want to manage.

Once an invitation has been created, you can check the status of it on the Group membership invitations page: [https://brainstem.org/private/users/groupmembershipinvitation/](https://brainstem.org/private/users/groupmembershipinvitation/).
