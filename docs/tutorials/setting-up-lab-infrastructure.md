## Introduction

Before conducting experiments in BrainSTEM, we recommend you establish your lab's infrastructure. This tutorial covers creating and configuring the foundational elements that support your research workflows: **setups** with **equipment** and **inventories** with **consumable stocks**. Proper infrastructure setup ensures smooth experiment creation and maintains consistency across your lab.

## Understanding Lab Infrastructure Components

BrainSTEM's lab infrastructure consists of four interconnected components:

1. **Setups**: Physical experimental environments (behavioral setup, recording rigs, surgical stations)
2. **Equipment**: Hardware devices used in your setups
3. **Inventories**: Organizational systems for tracking lab resources
4. **Consumable Stocks**: Specific items and materials in your inventories

These components work together to provide the foundation for documenting procedures, behaviors, data acquisition, and manipulations.

## Behavioral Paradigms

Behavioral paradigms are standardized experimental protocols (such as T-maze alternation, open field exploration, etc.) that are performed within a specific setup environment. In BrainSTEM, these are managed under *Personal Attributes → Behavioral Paradigms*.

For detailed instructions on creating, managing, and best practices for behavioral paradigms, see the dedicated tutorial: [Behavioral Paradigms]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/behavioral-paradigms).

> When planning your infrastructure, ensure that your setups have the correct environment type for the behavioral paradigms you intend to use.

## Planning Your Infrastructure

### Before You Begin
{: .no_toc}

1. **Audit your physical spaces**: List experimental environments in your lab
2. **Inventory your equipment**: Document devices, instruments, and tools
3. **Catalog your supplies**: Identify consumables, probes, drugs, and other materials
4. **Define access permissions**: Determine which group members need access to what resources

### Infrastructure Hierarchy

Understanding the relationships between components:

```
Setup (Physical Environment)
├── Equipment (Devices in that environment)
│   ├── Hardware devices (specific models/brands)
│   └── Coordinates systems (for positioning)
└── Associated with → Procedures, Behaviors, Data acquisition

Inventory (Storage/Organization System)
└── Consumable Stocks (Specific items)
    └── Associated with → Procedures
```

## Creating Setups

## Permission Management

Proper permission management ensures that the right people have access to the right resources while maintaining security and organization.

BrainSTEM infrastructure uses four permission levels for setups and inventories and therby inherited to equipment and consumable stocks:

| Permission Level | Capabilities |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Members** | View details<br>Read-only access<br>**Cannot** modify or create infrastructure |
| **Contributors** | All Member permissions<br>Create and modify associated equipment and consumable stocks. <br>Select setups and equipment when creating experiments<br>Select inventory and consumable stocks when creating experiments<br>**Cannot** modify setup settings or manage permissions |
| **Managers** | All Contributor permissions<br>Manage permissions for others<br>Configure setup specifications<br>**Cannot** delete infrastructure or transfer ownership |
| **Owners** | All Manager permissions<br>Full control over setups and equipment<br>Delete infrastructure components<br>Transfer ownership to other users<br>Complete administrative control |

**Best Practices for Assigning Permissions**:
- **Owners**: PI, lab manager, or senior lab members with equipment responsibility
- **Managers**: Postdocs or experienced graduate students who primarily use specific rigs
- **Contributors**: Lab members who regularly use the equipment for their research
- **Members**: All lab members who might occasionally need read access

### Group-Based Access
{: .no_toc}

**Recommended Group Structure**:
```
Lab Members (Basic access to most lab resources)
├── Graduate Students (Access to setups and equipment for their projects)
├── Postdocs (Broader access, can manage equipment in their research areas)
├── Lab Manager (Administrative access, inventory management)
├── PI and Senior Staff (Full ownership and administrative control)
└── Technique-Specific Groups (Optional, for specialized equipment)
    ├── Electrophysiology Users (Access to recording equipment and probes)
    ├── Imaging Users (Access to microscopes and imaging supplies)
    └── Behavior Users (Access to behavioral setups and paradigms)
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
{: .no_toc}

- **Setups**: Include location and be specific (e.g., "Room302_TmazeBehavior", "HeadFixed_2P_VR")
- **Equipment**: Include model and serial number (e.g., "IntanRHD2000_SN1234")
- **Inventories**: Include storage info (e.g., "Probes_RoomTemp", "Viruses_Minus80")
- **Consumable Stocks**: Include lot numbers and concentrations where applicable

### Documentation and Maintenance
{: .no_toc}

- Include technical specifications, calibration status, and safety considerations in descriptions
- Specify physical locations, storage conditions, and responsible contacts
- Update consumable stock levels monthly, review equipment quarterly, audit permissions annually
- Document modifications, update permissions when roles change, and archive rather than delete old equipment

## Integration with Experimental Workflows

### Using Infrastructure in Procedures
{: .no_toc}

When creating procedures, your infrastructure components become available:
- **Setups** provide the location context
- **Equipment** specifies tools used (stereotaxic frames, injection systems)
- **Consumable stocks** track materials consumed (probes, viruses, drugs)

### Using Infrastructure in Sessions
{: .no_toc}

Your setup determines available:
- **Equipment** for data acquisition modules
- **Behavioral paradigms** compatible with the environment type

## Troubleshooting

**Setup not available**: Verify authentication permissions and environment type compatibility

**Equipment missing from dropdowns**: Confirm correct setup assignment, equipment type alignment, and permission matching

**Consumable stock access issues**: Check group membership and owner/manager permissions
