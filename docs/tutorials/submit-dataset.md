# Submitting a dataset
{: .no_toc}

Submission of datasets is done through a multitab form, with each of the tabs dedicated to separate parts of the dataset:
* General metadata about the dataset.
* Online repositories: Any extra details on repositories where the data is shared.
* Behaviors: Behaviors are defined by the involved animal subjects (FK), the experimental setup (FK), and the behavioral paradigm (FK).
* Experiment data: Experiment data are defined by the type, any procedures (FK) which links to subjects, and the experment type-specific numeric and text fields. 
* Manipulations: Manipulations are defined by the type, any procedures (FK) which links to subjects, and the manipulation type-specifc numeric and text fields. 
* Epochs: Temporal aspects. Epochs are defined by a name, a time interval, and assignment of modules (Behaviors, Experiment data and Manipulations).
