Submission of datasets is done through a multitab form, with each of the tabs dedicated to separate parts of the dataset:
* General metadata about the dataset.
* Online repositories: Any extra details on repositories where the data is shared.
* Epochs: Temporal aspects. Epochs are defined by a name, a time interval, and assignment of module data.
* Behaviors: A module data type. Behaviors are defined by the involved animal subjects (FK), the physical environment (FK), and the behavioral paradigm (FK).
* Experiment data: A module data type. Experiment data are defined by the type, any actions (FK) which links to subjects, and the experment type-specific numeric and text fields.
