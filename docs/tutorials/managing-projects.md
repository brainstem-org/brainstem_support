# Managing projects
{: .no_toc}
Projects have four permission levels that can be defined for individual groups and users: members, change permissions, managers, and owners. Members have read access to project-related subjects, datasets, and module data. Change permissions allow for creation, editing and deletion of project related models. Managers can add and remove project members and project groups. Owners can manage project details and add and remove managers. Regular members can only leave the project.

To manage a project, go the the projects page [https://brainstem.org/private/stem/project/](https://brainstem.org/private/stem/project/) and click the group from the list you want to manage and click the Manage button at the top right of the page. 

__Managers__
New project member invitations can be created via the __Add user__ button at the bottom of the group management page. Once an invitation has been created, you can check the status of it on the Group membership invitations page: [https://brainstem.org/private/users/projectmembershipinvitation/](https://brainstem.org/private/users/projectmembershipinvitation/). 

Managers can also remove a user or a group from the project. To do so, go to the list of users and groups of the project, check off any user/group that you want to remove and click save. 

__Owners__
Owners of the project can also provide members with change permissions, manager and owner priviledges. To do so, go to the list of members of the project click any of the Change permissions / Managers / Owners checkfields and click the save button.
