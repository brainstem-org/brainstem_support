# Web interface

The web interface provides the primary way to interact with BrainSTEM, allowing users to enter, view, and manage their experimental data through an intuitive browser-based interface.

The interface consists of several main components:

- __Dashboard__: Provides an overview of your entries and recent activities
- __Submission Forms__: User-friendly forms for entering data  
- __List Views__: Table views showing individual models with flexible sorting and filtering
- __Single Entry Views__: Detailed pages showing comprehensive information about specific entries
- __User Profile__: Personal settings and preferences

Each of these components is described in detail in the following sections.
