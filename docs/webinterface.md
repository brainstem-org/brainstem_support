# Web interface

The web interface provides the primary way to interact with BrainSTEM, allowing users to enter, view, and manage their experimental data through an intuitive browser-based interface.

The interface consists of several main components:

- [__Submission Forms__]({{"webinterface/forms"|absolute_url}}): User-friendly forms for entering data  
- [__List Views__]({{"webinterface/list-view"|absolute_url}}): Table views showing individual models with flexible sorting and filtering
- [__Single Entry Views__]({{"webinterface/single-entry-view"|absolute_url}}): Detailed pages showing comprehensive information about specific entries
- [__User Profile__]({{"webinterface/user-profile"|absolute_url}}): Personal settings and preferences
- [__Import Tool__]({{"webinterface/import-tool"|absolute_url}}): Bulk data import using CSV templates
- [__Two-Factor Authentication__]({{"webinterface/two-factor-authentication"|absolute_url}}): Enhanced account security setup
