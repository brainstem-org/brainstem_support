# Web interface

The web interface provides the primary way to interact with BrainSTEM, allowing users to enter, view, and manage their experimental data through an intuitive browser-based interface.

The interface consists of several main components:

- [__Dashboard__]({{"webinterface/dashboard"|absolute_url}}): Provides an overview of your entries and recent activities
- [__Submission Forms__]({{"webinterface/forms"|absolute_url}}): User-friendly forms for entering data  
- [__List Views__]({{"webinterface/list-view"|absolute_url}}): Table views showing individual models with flexible sorting and filtering
- [__Single Entry Views__]({{"webinterface/single-entry-view"|absolute_url}}): Detailed pages showing comprehensive information about specific entries
- [__User Profile__]({{"webinterface/user-profile"|absolute_url}}): Personal settings and preferences

Each of these components is described in detail in the following sections.
