# BrainSTEM Documentation and Support Website

This repository hosts the documentation and support website for [BrainSTEM.org](https://brainstem.org). BrainSTEM is a collaborative electronic lab notebook for FAIR data sharing in neuroscience research. The website provides comprehensive documentation of the BrainSTEM platform: the data model, the web interface, the API and API tools, tutorials, and the public data-sharing portal.

You can view the documentation and support website at [support.brainstem.org](https://support.brainstem.org/).

The documentation is built using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme, which offers a clean, minimalistic design with easy navigation and search functionality.
